# GitHub Copilot Demos

This repository contains demonstration projects showcasing GitHub Copilot capabilities from its earliest versions, prior to the introduction of agent mode. While these examples were created to demonstrate Copilot's initial functionality, the techniques and outcomes remain highly relevant for understanding and refactoring existing code.

## Projects

### [`biz-rules-demo/`](./biz-rules-demo/)
Java-based demonstration of business logic implementation and rule-based systems using GitHub Copilot assistance.

### [`refactoring-demo/`](./refactoring-demo/)  
Java project showcasing code refactoring and legacy code improvement techniques with GitHub Copilot.

## Purpose

These demonstrations illustrate GitHub Copilot's early capabilities in:
- Code completion and pattern recognition
- Refactoring assistance and code improvement
- Business logic translation from requirements
- Clean code principle implementation

## Historical Context

Created before modern GitHub Copilot features like agent mode, these examples remain valuable for understanding AI-assisted development fundamentals. Recent advancements have significantly enhanced these capabilities, but the core techniques demonstrated here continue to be relevant for modern development practices.
